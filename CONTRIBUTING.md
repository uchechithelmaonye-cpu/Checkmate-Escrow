# Contributing to Checkmate-Escrow

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Checkmate-Escrow! This guide will help you get started.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or later
- Soroban CLI
- Stellar CLI
- Git

### Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/checkmate-escrow.git
   cd checkmate-escrow
   ```
3. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
   ```
5. Run tests to verify your setup:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test.sh
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation updates
- `refactor/` for code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. Write clear, concise commit messages
2. Keep commits focused on a single change
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Update documentation as needed

### Testing

Run the full test suite before submitting:

```bash
cargo test
```

For specific contract tests:

```bash
cargo test -p escrow
cargo test -p oracle
```

### Code Style

- Follow Rust standard formatting: `cargo fmt`
- Run clippy for linting: `cargo clippy`
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable names

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation in `docs/` for architectural changes
- Add inline comments for non-obvious code
- Add or update Soroban contract guidance in `docs/contributing-contracts.md` when changing contract storage, TTL, or auth behavior
- Add or update oracle guidance in `docs/CONTRIBUTING_ORACLE.md` when changing the oracle service, adding platform clients, or modifying result verification
- Update README.md if adding new features or changing setup steps
- Check repository health and link validity with `./scripts/repository_health_check.sh`

See [docs/repository-health-checklist.md](docs/repository-health-checklist.md) for checklist details.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch
3. Fill out the PR template with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Related issue numbers (if applicable)
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots (for UI changes)
4. Wait for review and address feedback

### PR Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update documentation
- Respond to review comments promptly
- Squash commits if requested

## Issue Labels

We use a shared label taxonomy to keep issue and PR triage consistent. See [docs/label-taxonomy.md](docs/label-taxonomy.md) for definitions of labels like `good first issue`, `wave-ready`, and `help-wanted`.

## Coding Standards

### Rust Conventions

- Use `snake_case` for functions and variables
- Use `PascalCase` for types and enums
- Prefer explicit error handling over panics
- Use `Result<T, Error>` for fallible operations
- Document public APIs with doc comments

### Smart Contract Patterns

- Validate all inputs at function entry
- Use appropriate storage types (instance, persistent, temporary)
- Extend TTL for long-lived data
- Emit events for state changes
- Require authentication for privileged operations

### Testing Standards

- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Use descriptive test names: `test_function_name_condition_expected_result`
- Mock external dependencies
- Verify events are emitted correctly

### Testing Conventions: Prefer `try_` Over `#[should_panic]`

When testing that a contract function returns a specific error, prefer the typed
`try_` variant over `#[should_panic]`. The `try_` approach asserts the *exact*
error variant, making failures easier to diagnose and preventing tests from
accidentally passing due to an unrelated panic.

**Avoid** — `#[should_panic]` only checks that *something* panicked:

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "Error(Contract, #10)")]
fn test_create_match_with_zero_stake_fails() {
    let (env, contract_id, _oracle, player1, player2, token, _admin) = setup();
    let client = EscrowContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    client.create_match(&player1, &player2, &0, &token,
        &String::from_str(&env, "game"), &Platform::Lichess);
}
```

**Prefer** — `try_` asserts the exact error variant:

```rust
#[test]
fn test_create_match_with_zero_stake_returns_invalid_amount() {
    let (env, contract_id, _oracle, player1, player2, token, _admin) = setup();
    let client = EscrowContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    let result = client.try_create_match(&player1, &player2, &0, &token,
        &String::from_str(&env, "game"), &Platform::Lichess);
    assert_eq!(result, Err(Ok(Error::InvalidAmount)));
}
```

Use `#[should_panic]` only for cases where the contract panics with a plain
string message rather than a typed error (e.g. double-initialization):

```rust
#[test]
#[should_panic(expected = "Contract already initialized")]
fn test_double_initialize_fails() {
    // ...
    client.initialize(&oracle, &admin);
    client.initialize(&oracle, &admin); // panics with a string, not a typed Error
}
```
