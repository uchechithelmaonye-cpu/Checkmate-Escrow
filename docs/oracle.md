# Oracle Integration Guide

This document describes how the off-chain oracle service interacts with the
Checkmate Escrow smart contracts, with a focus on the `game_id` field.

---

## game_id Format

The `game_id` field is a platform-specific string that uniquely identifies a
chess game. It is supplied when creating a match and must be passed to the
oracle when submitting a result. The oracle uses it to look up the game outcome
via the platform's public API.

### Lichess

Lichess game IDs are **8-character alphanumeric strings** (case-sensitive,
lowercase letters and digits).

They appear in the game URL:

```
https://lichess.org/abcd1234
                    ^^^^^^^^
                    game_id = "abcd1234"
```

Example API call the oracle makes:

```
GET https://lichess.org/game/export/abcd1234
```

Valid example: `"abcd1234"`  
Invalid examples: `"ABCD1234"` (uppercase), `"abcd123"` (7 chars), `""` (empty)

### Chess.com

Chess.com game IDs are **numeric strings**, typically 7–12 digits, found in
the live game URL:

```
https://www.chess.com/game/live/123456789
                                ^^^^^^^^^
                                game_id = "123456789"
```

Example API call the oracle makes:

```
GET https://api.chess.com/pub/game/123456789
```

Valid example: `"123456789"`  
Invalid examples: `"abc"` (non-numeric), `""` (empty)

## Validation Rules

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| Max length | 64 bytes (`MAX_GAME_ID_LEN`). Enforced on-chain — `create_match` returns `Error::InvalidGameId` if exceeded. |
| Uniqueness | Each `game_id` can only be used once. A duplicate returns `Error::DuplicateGameId`. |
| Format | Not validated on-chain. Passing a malformed ID will cause the oracle to fail result lookup off-chain. |
| Platform match | The `platform` field must match the source of the `game_id`. Mismatches are not caught on-chain but will cause oracle verification to fail. |

---

## Submitting a Result

Once a game is finished, the oracle calls `submit_result` on the escrow
contract with the `match_id`, `game_id`, and `Winner` enum:

```rust
// Winner::Player1 | Winner::Player2 | Winner::Draw
escrow_client.submit_result(&match_id, &winner, &oracle_address);
```

The oracle also records the result independently via `OracleContract::submit_result`:

```rust
oracle_client.submit_result(&match_id, &game_id, &MatchResult::Player1Wins);
```

---

## Result Deletion Policy (`delete_result`)

The oracle contract exposes a `delete_result` function that allows the admin to remove a previously submitted result from persistent storage:

```rust
oracle_client.delete_result(&match_id); // → Result<(), Error>
```

### Why it exists

On-chain persistent storage has a finite TTL (~30 days). In normal operation results expire naturally. `delete_result` exists for two narrow operational cases:

1. **Erroneous submission** — the oracle submitted a result for the wrong `match_id` (e.g., due to a bug or misconfiguration) before the escrow payout was triggered. Deletion allows the correct result to be re-submitted.
2. **Storage reclamation** — proactively freeing storage rent for results that are no longer needed (e.g., after a dispute is fully resolved off-chain).

### Trust assumptions and risks

`delete_result` is an admin-only operation and is **blocked while the contract is paused**. Despite these guards, deletion carries meaningful trust implications:

| Risk | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Audit trail removal | Deleting a result removes the on-chain record of that outcome. Anyone relying solely on `get_result` for historical verification will see `ResultNotFound` after deletion. |
| Re-submission after deletion | Once deleted, a new result can be submitted for the same `match_id`. A compromised or malicious admin could use this to alter the apparent outcome of a match. |
| Payout already executed | If the escrow payout has already been triggered by `submit_result`, deleting the oracle record does not reverse the payout. The escrow contract state is independent. |

### Expected operational use

- **Do not** use `delete_result` as routine cleanup. Results should be left to expire naturally via TTL.
- **Do** use it only to correct a demonstrably erroneous submission, and only before the corresponding escrow `submit_result` has been called.
- Any deletion should be logged off-chain (e.g., via the admin's operational runbook) since the on-chain event record will no longer contain the original submission after deletion.
- In production, admin keys should be held in a multi-sig wallet so that deletion requires multiple approvals, reducing the risk of unilateral misuse.

## has_result vs has_result_admin

The oracle contract exposes two ways to check whether a result has been
submitted for a given `match_id`.

### `has_result` — public, unauthenticated

```rust
oracle_client.has_result(&match_id); // → bool
```

This is a read-only probe that returns `true` once a result has been stored.
It requires **no authentication** and can be called by anyone.

This is intentional: the function exposes only the *existence* of a result,
not its content. For the majority of public tournament contexts this is
acceptable — knowing that *a* result exists leaks no information about *who*
won.

### `has_result_admin` — admin-gated

```rust
oracle_client.has_result_admin(&match_id); // → Result<bool, Error>
```

For private tournaments where even the existence of a result must remain
confidential until an official announcement, use this variant instead. It
requires the stored admin to authorise the call, preventing third-party
probing.

Returns `Error::Unauthorized` if the caller is not the current admin.

## Data Structures

### ResultEntry

The `ResultEntry` struct stores a verified match result in the oracle contract's
persistent storage. Each entry is keyed by `match_id`.

```rust
pub struct ResultEntry {
    pub game_id: String,
    pub result: Winner,
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `game_id` | `String` | Platform-specific game identifier (e.g., `"abcd1234"` for Lichess, `"123456789"` for Chess.com) |
| `result` | `Winner` | The verified outcome of the match |

Example values:

```rust
ResultEntry {
    game_id: String::from_str(&env, "abcd1234"),
    result: Winner::Player1,
}

ResultEntry {
    game_id: String::from_str(&env, "987654321"),
    result: Winner::Draw,
}
```

### Winner

The `Winner` enum represents the possible outcomes of a chess match. It mirrors
the escrow contract's `Winner` enum for consistency.

```rust
pub enum Winner {
    Player1,
    Player2,
    Draw,
}
```

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `Player1` | Player 1 won the match |
| `Player2` | Player 2 won the match |
| `Draw` | The match ended in a draw (stakes are refunded) |

## Example: Full Match Lifecycle

```
1. player1 calls create_match(
       player1, player2,
       stake_amount = 100_000_000,
       token = USDC_ADDRESS,
       game_id = "abcd1234",       // Lichess game ID
       platform = Platform::Lichess
   )

2. player1 calls deposit(match_id, player1)
3. player2 calls deposit(match_id, player2)
   → match state transitions to Active

4. Game is played on Lichess.

5. Oracle fetches result from https://lichess.org/game/export/abcd1234
   → player1 wins

6. Oracle calls escrow.submit_result(match_id, Winner::Player1, oracle_address)
   → player1 receives 2 × stake_amount
```
